*** fork to try out different presets for 8bitdo m30 controller running firmware 1.10 - current version of Blueretro only work with firmware 1.15 and the button mapping is not very good for using the gamecube version with wii emulators.

Since v1.8.2-5-gb607dd2, without any changes to the code, the 8bitdo M30 can be paired in Switch Mode (start + y) and reconnect with start.

With this, I don't need to connect in d-input anymore, since Switch mode has that same button mapping.
